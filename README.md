Simple sample programs for learning Arduino.

All diagrams and code were developed on the Arduino UNO, as part
of a series of Arduino tutorials hosted at puzzlingquest.com.

Most directories have an .ino file containing Arduino code, 
which loads in the Arduino IDE. (arduino.org)

Most directories also have an .fzz file containing the related 
circuit design, which loads in Fritzing. (fritzing.org)

"Arduino UNO Base.fzz" is a base template to start from when
designing simple Aurdino UNO circuits.
